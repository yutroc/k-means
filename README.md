# K-means  
A simple implementation of k-means, trying to make it similar to the sklearn interface.
The test data is from: http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/ 

### Usage
First you must get the necessary packages:

`pip install -r requirement.txt`

The solution consists of the `Kmeans` class and you can use it like this:

`kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=16).fit(data)`

also, you can see the `example.py` file as a guide.
